# Types of Operator

# An Operator is a symbol that perform certain operation between operands

# Arithmetics Operator (-,+,*,**,%,/) (They are generally user for general maths operation)
a = 34
b = 23
'''
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a//b) It divides a by b, but instead of giving you the decimal result, it gives you the whole number part only, rounded down.
print(a**b) # it means a square b a^b
print(a/b) # it is uses for devision and it output will always be in (float)
print(a%b)   # Module(name of %) and it is uses for finding the remainder of a two numbers
'''
# Rational/Comparison Operator(==,!=,>,<,>=,<=) It is genrally uses for comparision, and it output will be in True or False
'''
a = 34
b = 35

print(a==b)
print(a!=b)
print(a>=b)
print(a<=b)
print(a>b)
print(a<b)
'''
# Assignment Operator(=,+=,-=,*=,%=,**=,/=)
# num = 23
# num = num+2/4             it similar to below content
# num += 24
# num -= 24
# num /= 24
# num %= 24
# num *= 24
# num **= 24
# print(f'Num: {num}')

# Logical Operator(and,not,or) Logical operator works on boolean operators

# a = True
# b = False
# print(f'And Operator: {a and b}')
# print(f'Or Operator: {a or b}')
# print(f"Not Operator:{not a}")
# print(f"Not Operator:{not b}")
